    <h3> About This Game</h3>
    <p>This game is played like dominoes, but there is a twist! This deck has 36 cards instead
        of the 28 that would be in a traditional dominoes game. Also, each card has an inspirational
        word on it from the Bible chosen specifically to remind players to remain positive while
        playing the game. The game was developed by Knowble, and is considered one of the best
        versions of game designed to bring generations of families together, while at the same time
        teaching foundational religious content.
