    <h3> Instructions </h3>
<p> First, select the number of players for the game. Next, tap the “DEAL” button,
    and allow the website to create a hand for each player. The player with the “7-7”
    card plays first (taps their card causing it to move the center of the screen).
    The player to the left of the person who plays first make the next play. This
    player MUST play a card that matches at least one number of ANY of the cards that
    have been previously played (in this case, a card with a “7”). The program will
    automatically place this card perpendicular (to for a “T”) to the first card played.
    Play then moves to the next player (and so on), who again MUST play a card that
    matches at least one number of ANY of the cards that have been previously played.

    <h4>Scoring </h4>

   <p> The object of the game is to be the first player to reach 150 points. Points are
    awarded if the numbers on the ends of the cards (OUTSIDE NUMBERS) from ANY of the
    cards equal a multiple of 5. If a play is made that does not result in the numbers
    on the ends of the cards equalling a multiple of 5, play just moves to the next
    player. Each hand is over once one player plays his/her last card, at which time
    ALL OF THE REMAINING CARDS are awarded to this player. The nearest multiple of 5 of
    the sum of ALL of the numbers on each of these cards is added to this player’s score.
    The game will automatically reshuffle the cards and deal a new hand to each player.
    Play resumes with the player who played the last card playing ANY card to begin the
    next hand. Play continues until one player’s score reaches 150 points.
    <br>

    <h4>Special Situations</h4>
    <p>
        <li>If a player cannot match ANY of the numbers on the ends of the cards, the player MUST either PASS (play passes to the next player), or choose a card from the “Boneyard”. If there are no cards in the Boneyard, play automatically passes to the next player. </li>
        <li>Cards with the same number on each side are ALWAYS played sideways (perpendicular) to the number it matches. Cards with the same number represent the total amount of both numbers (Example: 5 - 5 card has a value of 10.</li>
        <li>If no one has the “7-7” card at the beginning of the game, the player with the HIGHEST DOUBLE NUMBER CARD plays first. Play continues with the player to the left of this player playing next.
            Only the FIRST double number card can have cards played on all four sides of it. </li>
    </ul>
